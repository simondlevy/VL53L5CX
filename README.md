# VL53L5
Arduino library for ST Microelectronics VL53L5 multizone Time-of-Flight ranging camera
(get it [here](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/vl53l5cx-ranging-camera/)!)

## Quickstart

1. Connect I<sup>2</sup>C in the usual way (SCL, SDA, 3.3V, GND)

2. Connect INT and LPN to digital pins on your board, making sure the pin
numbers agree with the [pin numbers](https://github.com/simondlevy/VL53L5/blob/main/examples/GetSetParams/GetSetParams.ino#L15-L16) specified in the 
<b>GetSetParams</b> test sketch.

3. Flash the <b>GetSetParams</b> test sketch onto your board.

4. After a few seconds you should see the LED turn on solid.

5. A few seconds after that, the LED should start blinking.  

6. Open the serial monitor to observer the rangefinder readings.
